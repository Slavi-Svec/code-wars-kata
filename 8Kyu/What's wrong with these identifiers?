An identifier is simply a name...
Can you amend this object so that its properties comprise only vaild identifiers?

var Person = {
  1stname: "John",
  second-name: "Doe",
  email@ddress: "john.doe@email.com",
  male.female: "M"
};

// Solution 

const Person = {
  firstName: "John",
  secondName: "Doe",
  emailAddress: "john.doe@email.com",
  gender: "M",
};
